# School District Analysis

## Overview of the School District Analysis
The strength of an education system and the resources it has are essential for student success. City school districts are responsible for analyzing data, at the student and school level, from multiple sources and in various formats, which ultimately provide insight on how well students are performing, the size of school budgets and overall priorities. For the School District Analysis project, student’s math and reading scores will be analyzed, along with information on the schools they attend. By aggregating this data, trends on school performance can be identified and utilized to implement strategic decisions at the school and district level.  

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to evaluate the math and reading grades for Thomas High School students. A key dataset utilized in evaluating the analysis, indicates that there is evidence of academic dishonesty, as the grades for ninth grade students appear to have been altered. In an effort to uphold state-testing standards, a comparative analysis will be completed which will indicate whether replacing math and reading scores for Thomas High School ninth grade students with NaNs, which means ‘not a number’ and cannot be equal, will affect the overall analysis.

### Resources Utilized to Complete Analysis

## Results
The questions below address the results of the comparative analysis.

- **How is the district summary affected?**

The district summary comparison shows that the main difference between the initial and updated analysis is that the average math score decreased by 0.1% and the percent of students who passed math decreased by 0.2%. The average reading score remained the same, but the percent of students who passed reading decreased by 0.3%. The overall percent of students who passed only varied by 0.1%.

-	**How is the school summary affected?**

The school summary indicates that Thomas High School was the only school whose scores were affected. There was a slight variance with the average math and reading scores, however the most significant changes in the data were with respect to the the percentange of students who passed math and reading. The initial analysis shows that the percentage of Thomas Jefferson Students who passed math dropped from 93.272171% down to 66.911315% and the percentage who passed reading also dropped from 97.308869% to 69.663609%.

-	**How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?**

By replacing the ninth graders' math and reading scores, Thomas High School's performance ranking dropped from having the fourth highest scores in the district, to the seventh. 


-	**How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:**
  - *Math and Reading Scores by Grade:* Ninth grade math and reading scores were not impacted
  - *Scores by School Spending:* 
  - *Scores by School Size:*
  - *Scores by School Type:*


## Summary
By conducting the comparative analysis, four major changes are evident in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for ninth grade Thomas High School students were replaced with NaNs.
1. Charter Schools performance is stronger than those of District Schools
2. 
3. 
4.
